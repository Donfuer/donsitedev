   <p class='hp'>In 2013, D_loaded logged onto his friend Ben's server. Ben was upset that his city had been completely taken over by The Highwaymen, a rival group. D and Ben built a city named "Don Fuer", a mistranslation of "Father's Gift", that was very close to spawn. The city was eventually destroyed and the second Don Fuer was erected nearby, but was eventually found as well. After the map was reset, a third DonFuer was built and used as the main city of the new map. After a long and chaotic war with the Highwaymen, which saw the first use of the Donfuerian Hitting Rod superweapon, it was finally destroyed. The fourth Donfuer was built underground with a decoy town on top of it, which became Donfuer 5 after it grew bigger than the town it was protecting. Both were presumed to be destroyed along with the entire world by either a hacker group or Ben, who may have deleted or corrupted the save.</p>

	<p class='hp'>In late 2014, D_loaded and Ben moved to a small faction server, establishing Donfuer 6 next to a friendly PVP faction. D built the city alone, offering free houses to anyone who promised to defend the city. When he logged on one day to find Donfuer 6 destroyed, he rebuilt the entire city the following weekend, calling it Donfuer 7. Donfuer allied with another PVP faction and both factions built a castle and a bridge to each other’s city. Ben finally returned, but with him came the Highwaymen, who destroyed the cities. Donfuer 8 was built on an unnamed faction server that D had operator status on, with the Donfuerian Hitting Rods becoming even stronger. This city fell when the server ran out of money and shut down.</p>

	<p class='hp'>One year later, D_loaded met HermeticLock and built Donfuer 9 on a faction server called MozartRealms. He moved to AnarchyHeroes, Herm’s server, which was backdoored and filled with “illegal items”. Eventually, Donfuer moved to 2b2t when the Vortex Coalition invaded the server. Donfuer 9 was destroyed in a Donfuerian Civil War, where Donfuer’s 2b2t members fought its members from AnarchyHeroes. After Donfuer 10 was griefed by Babbaj on 2b2t, Donfuer 11 was created, but was eventually abandoned as HermeticLock started the Spawnmasons. Donfuer 12 followed Donfuer 11, but would be the final Donfuer base on 2b2t before Donfuer’s 3-year-long hiatus. Donfuer 13 was built on IcedMC, an obscure faction server with a crazy admin named Archery. After Donfuer member Dragonworm built a small watercube at spawn, Archery destroyed Donfuer 13.</p>

	<p class='hp'>After this, Donfuer moved back to AnarchyHeroes and built Donfuer 14. Donfuer created a new iteration of the 32k Donfuerian Hitting Rod, which upset established players on the server. After a failed “Revolution” attempt, they destroyed Donfuer 14. Many members joined Donfuer after this, and paid reparations to the group. Donfuer 15, a base on another server called AMC, was destroyed by member Blaze_Warfare, who had lost an online game against D_loaded. Donfuer 16 was the last Donfuer base on AnarchyHeroes, which had been sold to a new owner. It was built on one of the oldest sites on the server, and it was not named until it was destroyed. Donfuer 17 was built on Geocraft, even becoming a warp hub for Alaska, but member Blaze_Warfare got D_loaded banned and the faction disbanded. After this, the group became inactive and despite many promotions, D_loaded eventually disbanded Donfuer in 2019.</p>

	<p class='hp'>After a short break, D_loaded came back to 2b2t in March of 2020 and was a member of a base with the Spawnmasons. No one else built at the base, and so D decided to call it DonFuer 18. This caused enough drama for a FitMC video, and D_loaded and HermeticLock were reunited. On the server DestroyMC, UpliftSage317, FaT_EaRtHeR, Whygoodboyg, dragonworm, and MikelAx7 came back and DonFuer was reborn, with FaT, Uplift, dragonworm, and Whygoodboyg on the new council of kings. Donfuer built a base with Uplift’s group, Deadwood, while MikelAx7 built spawnbases with lower ranks. In mid 2020, D_loaded finally returned to 2b2t, forming a branch there with dragonworm. While D_loaded built several new bases, each greater than the last, many new members joined Donfuer. Donfuer 10 was rebuilt on the exact same spot where it had previously stood, a feat not many other groups can claim to have achieved.</p>

	<p class='hp'>On DestroyMC, Deadwood and Donfuer worked together to build DonWood, a base that was regarded as the capital city of the server. Donfuer’s elders had grown concerned with Deadwood’s moves to absorb Donfuer completely, and so dragonworm griefed DonWood on an alt. MikelAx7 arrived just as he was leaving, and he alerted the rest of the group immediately. Donfuer and Deadwood went on their separate ways, each wary of the other. On the 2b2t branch, D_loaded built a base named Karakorum in a Japanese style, which made it unique compared to previous Donfuer bases. After it was griefed, it was officially named ChongFuer, after members began affectionately calling it that.</p>

	<p class='hp'>After DMC died, the branch moved to NetherAnarchy, and MikelAx7 stepped up to lead this branch. Donfuer Spawn Rangers was created in December, and member Zeiss was put in charge of the branch. This branch was made to prevent insiders from joining the main base directly, which keeps the base much safer and allows for more people to be involved with the group. As this branch grew larger than the main branch, member volker1 was eventually promoted to help manage the group and all 2b2t applicants were directed to Donfuer Spawn Rangers. D_Loaded started a new branch on Stoneworks, but it was sold off to Nova Regna, a group that offered control back to Donfuer at any time. Donfuer returned to Stoneworks in September of 2021, and remains there until this present day.</p>

	<p class='hp'>Donfuer 20, possibly the largest Donfuer base ever, was built on 2b2t in 2021. After this, Donfuer 21 was built but later griefed. After noble Spartan420 doxxed the admin of NetherAnarchy (forcing it to shut down) and caused drama within Donfuer itself, he was banned. Donfuer’s NetherAnarchy branch moved to PhoenixAnarchy, and it remains there today. The five active branches of Donfuer are on 2b2t, 9b9t, PhoenixAnarchy, Stoneworks, and Minewind, and there is something here for everyone!</p>
