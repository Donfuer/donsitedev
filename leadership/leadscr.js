        blurb: "In August of 2013, D_loaded logged on to his new friend Ben\'s Minecraft server. It was here that he built the first Donfuer. The city was immediately griefed but the name, a supposed mistranslation of \"Father\'s Gift\", stuck and became the name for all the large bases made after. The Donfuerian empire grew slowly over the years as cities rose and fell on many different servers. D_loaded still is in Donfuer today, as its longest serving member.",

After showing dragonworm the server weeks later, he followed him to Highland and later Donfuer. His membership record was spotty but now he fully committed his playtime to the success of Donfuer. He also created the former DonFuer website and is a developer of the DonHack client. He recently changed his IGN to DirectorJohnson.",

Things would quickly sour with Highland, and soon after he joined Donfuer. Dragonworm quickly became an elder after joining by proving his loyalty to D_loaded in a series of crusades on MozartRealms. Since then, he has managed the online presence of Donfuer. He is currently the 3rd oldest Donfuer member that is still around.",

After slowly gaining trust within DonFuer he would be invited to DonFuer 23 in June 2022. His contributions to the group so far have been improving the group's wealth, and doing administration in the group with D_loaded",

        blurb: "In April 2022, N8TT discovered the DonFuer ranger base Katadalanfrantaranfueristan and was invited to join the group by Joetheblue. Though offered an immediate promotion to Ranger rank, N8TT opted to start as a scout and quickly proved himself by contributing to projects like the rebuilding of Aureus City and DonFuer 25. His hard work and dedication earned him the respect of the DonFuer community, and he remains a valued member of the group.",

He applied to DonFuer's newly created Spawn Rangers group and made many friends, both in the group and out. He was very active, and was invited to DonFuer 21 with a couple friends. D_loaded eventually offered him leadership of Spawn Rangers, which he accepted. He set to work improving the group by building a new website from the ground up, getting more high-ranking Donfuerians active in Rangers, and more.",
