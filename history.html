        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>D_loaded and Ben built the first Don Fuer on Ben's server while attempting to take back Ben's city from the Highwaymen, a rival group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>A second Don Fuer was built on the ruins of the city, but was eventually found. After a map reset, a third DonFuer was built to function as a main area for the new map.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
                <p>DonFuer 4 was built underground on Ben's server. To protect it, a decoy town was built on the surface, but was renamed to DonFuer 5 once it grew bigger than DonFuer 4.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 6 was built on a small factions server next to an allied faction. After it was griefed, D_loaded rebuilt it in a single weekend, calling it DonFuer 7.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer had a branch on 2b2t and a branch on AnarchyHeroes, HermeticLock's server. DonFuer 9 was griefed in a "civil war" between its 2b2t and AnarchyHeroes members.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 10 was built on 2b2t, but was eventually griefed by Babbaj while HermeticLock was touring the base.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 11 was created, but then abandoned when HermeticLock starts the Spawn Masons. After DonFuer 12, Donfuer moved to a small factions server called IcedMC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 13 was built on IcedMC, but the server owner griefed the city after a DonFuer member built a watercube at spawn.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer moved back to AnarchyHeroes, and after a server-wide "revolution" mostly consisting of older players, the "rebels" apologized and joined Donfuer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer moved to AMC and built DonFuer 15. It was eventually griefed by a member after losing a supcom game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 17 was built on a server called GeoCraft and was notable enough to become a warp hub for its region.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>After DonFuer left GeoCraft, it became inactive. D_loaded promoted many people, but the group became inactive and D_loaded disbanded DonFuer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>After a short break, D_loaded returned to 2b2t and joined the Spawn Masons. As the solo builder of their base, he decided to call it DonFuer 18.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>A FitMC video was made about DonFuer and the Spawn Masons, and HermeticLock and D_loaded created the Guardsmen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>Leaders of DonFuer rebuilt the group and move to DestroyMC. DonFuer and allied group Deadwood built a group base, however, Donfuer's elders decided to grief the base after Deadwood's intentions became clearer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>D_loaded and Dragonworm built several new bases on 2b2t, most notably ChongFuer, and the group was revived on 2b2t.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer DMC moved to NetherAnarchy, but had to abandon Donfuer 19 and move to PhoenixAnarchy when NetherAnarchy shut down.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 20 was built on 2b2t, but was leaked to the Spawn Masons. Over a long period of time, they harassed the base members until they eventually griefed the base.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 2b2t started recruiting through Spawn Rangers, a separate division. As the division grew, Zeiss and volker1 were promoted to help manage things.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>D_loaded started a new branch on Stoneworks, a factions server. While it had a rough start, it eventually survived and grew enough to rival other branches.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>DonFuer 21 was built on 2b2t, and was one of the only DonFuer bases to have a mostly modern theme.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='histcontent rawbg '><div class='nope'></div>
            <p>Donfuer 22, the biggest Donfuer base ever, was built after the Nocom exploit went public. It was griefed by former members who used the infamous Log4Shell exploit to hack a group member.</p>
