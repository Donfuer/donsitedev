Donfuer site to catch bugs and show off to people
# log1
optimized navpane code for faster page loading, removed some unused code, updated index a tiny bit
- Included remaking the small popup, only inage assets loaded are 3 SVG files, which may even be removed in the future, who knows
- optimized navpane html, divider is a pseudo element now. also did some touch ups on its css
- optimized the title morph a bit, now it is a single html element instead of 3 separate ones - changing css with js
- videos scale with only css, idfk why I did it the other way beforehand
- Requestiong your help --- screenshot any bugs not listed in the TODO and screenshot your user agent (should be in the 9b9t description on apply.html)-----------

TODO:


- replace or delete png icons - Keep It Simple, Stupid
- scale things for mobile
- fix the godawful centering on the titlebar, idek why it does it like this
- optimize everything more, everyone complains about the gallery in particular
- put background image on separate div, to fix an annoying bug I found on mobile
- might as well just write the damn 9b9t blurb myself if no one else is going to do it
- fix history, talk to D about updating it to include Donfuer 22 as well as anything notable that happened with the non-anarchy branches
- add Timeofwheel to leadership, also update Mikel to DirectorJohnson
- -- might want to add some sort of thing for who runs each branch as well on here, this page needs some tlc
- put a <nojs> element up to warn people about all the terrible things that happen to those foolish enough to care about their privacy
  
LONG-TERM TODO:
  
- cookies on the site for anonymous metrics such as average visitor location, average whatever window.navigator info we want, etc
- separate pages for mobile users - gallery.php and any other pages that are really heavy, maybe even use XMLHttpRequest on the desktop site
- a way that D can edit or add stuff to the site without having to know what the fuck I was thinking at 1:30 am cst on January 8th, 2022 when I wrote something the way I did
