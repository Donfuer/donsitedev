cl7:
the folder is a mess, sorry. I will fix it when I make it all folder-y tho so it's cool. open index.html in ur browser
History page is pretty much done, give me feedback on the rewrite or i will beat ur ass on 2b2tpvp
apply pages are done as well, I hope the stoneworks and minewind ppl aren't coping too hard about a couple junk applications floating their way without any context...
gallery was updated, give me feedback on this or I will destroy your entire family on 2b2tpvp
fixed layout bugs that were making me cringe hard
removed some url pointer bugs, apparently I was not diligent enough in removing the clean folder code from apply
cleaned up some stuff and did debugging
new scrollbars everywhere
TODO:
Make apply page css less jank
put icons on the social media links in navbar
incorporate that really cool Donfuer 20 building video on at least one of teh site's backgrounds
targeted harassment of D_loaded, MikelAx7, TimeofWheel, and one of the Minewind ppl for their apply pitches.
^^ DONT MAKE THEM TOO LONG ^^
get D alone in a vc to get more content for history page
redo the small navbar because I hate how it looks and also it is very buggy (if you have not seen it, resize ur window to a small size and load the page)
revamp leadership page so it isn't all in thin columns (and ask D if I can be in it as well because spawn rangers and also I made the site lmao)
Make a timezone converter thingy. People won't understand the UTC shit and if they do they're too nerd for Donfuer
cl6:
Made navbar for smol screens (bad tho needs to be smaller. maybe just text)
fixed horizontal bs rows, now in container-fluid. removed overflow-x:hidden
individual bg for each type of page
added application pages
preview of clean URLs -- for now requires dev server. https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

TODO
Finish apply pages and history stuff
make history page actually work out alright in terms of styling
^ need layout ideas ^
replace the pictures in gallery with new and better ones
cl5:
Made join discord and the donfuer yt channel button separate so people won't misclick
made navbar smexier
made the headers for all the pages scroll nicely
revamped the homepage - should we keep our fit video up there?
- also put in links on the bottom of the homepage
put in the first section of Donfuer history. Will modify the contents slightly to flow better.

TODO
navbar hamborger menu
different bg images
make the apply pages
harass MikelAx7
when projecct is complete - folderize everything and also make .htaccess work as intended. Does not want to work on localhost.

changelog 4 or something
new navbar lmao
pretty much threw this together in liike 6 hours or so idrk
might put the join discord button on the bottom with little discord icons, and also the df yt channels
someone should probably write some things for the df branches on apply page
I put the gallery imgs all at a 1920x1080-proportioned size in an image editor to reduce jank
also used bootstrap gallery for this
Leadership page - clicking on leader cards takes you to their namemc, also might want to rewrite some of this
to be grammatically correct
same with history, some of the information could be summarized, also displaying all the text at once or maybe
a scroll select would be good because then it puts the focus on the important content
would like more images for gallery

to do
make navbar scale good for phones and poor ppl computers- basically go into hammborger menu if screen is small
make titlebars scroll into a nice floating head thingy
make the join discord button distinct and put in yt and other social media
get different background images for each page. Using background blur twice on the same patch is glitching for me so I might
just blur them in my image editor
make apply stuff, pages, etc with embed forms. also maybe descriptions
put stuff in different folders so no one sees ugly file names (do this on completion, also fix file paths)
WHY did mikel change his name to fucking Director Johnston or whatever. WHY
