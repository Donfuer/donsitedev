          <p>A <span class="ign">FitMC</span> video was made about DonFuer and the Spawn Masons and afterwards, <span class="ign">HermeticLock</span> and <span class="ign">D_loaded</span> created the Guardsmen.</p>

          <p>Leaders of Donfuer rebuilt the group and moved to DestroyMC. Donfuer and allied group Deadwood built a group base, however, Donfuer's elders decided to grief the base after Deadwood's intentions became clearer.</p>

          <p><span class="ign">D_loaded</span> and <span class="ign">Dragonworm</span> built several new bases on 2b2t, most notably <span class="base">Chongfuer</span>, and the group was revived on 2b2t.</p>

          <p><span class="base">Donfuer 20</span> was built on 2b2t, but was leaked to the Spawn Masons. Over a long period of time, they harassed the base members until they eventually griefed the base.</p>

          <p>Due to popular demand, Donfuer 2b2t started recruiting through Spawn Rangers, a separate division. As the division grew, <span class="ign">Zeiss</span> and <span class="ign">volker1</span> were promoted to help manage things.</p>

        <div class='histcontent'>
          <p><span class="ign">D_loaded</span> started a new branch on Stoneworks, a geopolitical roleplaying server that was very different from where the group was. While it had a rough start, it eventually survived and grew enough to rival other branches.</p>
